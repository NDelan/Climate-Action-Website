		<p>Climate change is a global phenomenon that is affecting the Earth's climate system in unprecedented ways. Human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes have resulted in increased greenhouse gas emissions, leading to rising temperatures, melting ice caps, and more extreme weather events. The impacts of climate change are most evident in vulnerable areas such as small island states, coastal cities, and arctic regions.</p>
